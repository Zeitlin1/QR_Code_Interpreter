# QR_Code_Interpreter
Designed to scan, encrypt, and decrypt QR codes read via iPhone 7 camera.

I designed a simple QR code reader to read any QR code and produce a hash array using SHA-256 encryption.  This is the same encryption used by Bitcoin an block-chain protocols.  Once the hash table has been created only scanning the original QR code will confirm the QR code matches and when a match occurs the phone tells you by lighting up green.
